##  ArtDeco - Project ( ITI  Intensive Code Camp -  Graduation Project) 
 

## Who are we ?
ArtDeco is a promising startup that aims to solve one of the main problems we face when we try to decorate our home, apartment, or even our company. We get frustrated and overwhelmed by the offers, the marketplace, the quality of material, etc. Here comes our part, which is to create a place where the customer can finally fulfill his/her dreams by just picking the best offers made to him/her by the available companies. So, we help the customer to have the luxury and the variety of options to choose from and have a satisfying experience.<br>
